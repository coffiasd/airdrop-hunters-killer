      "description": "Project Core:\r\n\t4C hopes to become the Bridge of Web3 and Comics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Introduction:\r\n\t4C is a Web3 community that helps creators create comics.\r\n\r\n\tIn 4C, NFT HOLDER can support comic creators to create deviate and in-depth comics in the form of authorized NFT. Deviate works can be free-minted as NFTs at \t\t\t4C, and the subsequent transaction proceeds of these deviate NFTs will be shared with authorized NFT holders and creators. In addition, 4C mainly includes two parts: \t4C CLUB and 4C DAO. The mission of 4C CLUB is to make every NFT have a good comic story and generate new transactions and value around these comic NFTs. \tThe 4C DAO's mission is much more difficult, to help comic creators create great comic stories.\r\n\r\n\tWe believe that Web3 will give birth to a new batch of world-class comic creators and comic stories, and Web3 should have a new \"Marvel\".\r\n\r\nProject Highlights:\r\n\tAdequate amount of derived NFT IP\r\n\tMore accessible to creating comics for Web 3\r\n\tEverlasting work of art\r\n\tNO PUBLICATION FEE\r\n\tFREE MINT\r\n\t$C token rewards\r\n",
