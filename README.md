# Airdrop-Hunters-Killer

## Overview

This is OpenData-Community hackathon project build for identify sybil attackers on blockchains. As we know it's easy for sybil attackers to isolation addresses.Advanced sybil attackers usually cut off the connection between their addresses.Hence it's hard for us to find out the sybil addresses via address relation.I think the biggest difference between real account and sybil account is that sybil attackers don't spend enough time on their each address.This will cause sybil account appear the below features:

- **Activity degree** is lower than ordinary account
- **Interaction diversity** is lower than ordinary account
- **Interaction density** is lower than ordinary account

So i wanna create an algorithm to estimate each score of above features.
